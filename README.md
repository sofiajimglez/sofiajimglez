Hi! 😊 I'm a **software developer** with +5 years of experience in **design** and **digital marketing**.

Last year, I decided to turn my career around and **focus on development** taking a bootcamp where I have learned technologies such as **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **NodeJS**, **Express**, **MongoDB** and **React**. Since then, as part of Driblab -a technology startup based on football analytics with big data-, I am developing dynamic front-end interfaces with **Vue.js** while gaining experience in back-end systems with **Java** and **PostgreSQL**.

I consider myself a **committed**, **problem-solving** and **fast-learning** professional. 

Let's talk and explore how I can bring value to your team! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects and looking for a job as junior web developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Typescript
- 🎨 Fun fact: I studied Fine Arts at College
- 👩🏻‍💻 Let's connect in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiajimglez/)!
